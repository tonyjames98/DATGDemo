# Version History
## Version 1.1.5 - 02/14/2018
* **New Utilities**
  * PageLoaded.isJQueryComplete
    * Will check page is see if jQuery is valid on page before checking all jQuery sessions are complete
* **General**   
	* Fixed potential bug in DriverManager when a driver fails to create, the service can be orphaned
	* Fixed bug where internal reload and Webtable getCell were returning WebElement instead of Element
	* Deprecating PageLoaded isElementLoaded and OrasiDriver.page.isElementLoaded in favor of it now being handled internally. Any sync will work in its place now
	* Deprecating PageLoaded method that required OrasiDriver to be passed as parameter in favor of DriverManager
 

## Version 1.1.4 - 02/06/2018
* **POM.xml**
  * Updating to Selenium 3.7.0
    * Removing support for HTMLUnit and PhantomJSDriver in favor of headless option for Firefox and Chrome
  * Cleaned up unused dependencies and parameterized all version numbers for ease of use
* **General**
  * Pulling in and enhanced Selenium classes to support Generics for better handling of elements
  and allowing use of findElements to return a List of Orasi Elements
  * Moved default location for driver storage to resolve issue where unclosed driver sessions prevented project from refreshing
  * Fixed issue in syncEnabled where if an element was under another element, syncEnabled would throw an ElementNotClickableException   
  * Fixed issue during element reload where under certain conditions, element timeouts were not being honoured    
  * Fixed issue when Listbox was instantiated and the element was not found, the proper error was buried within a proxy exception
  * Fixed issue when driver fails to take a screenshot, it would throw exception. Now it will simply log an error
  * Added an option in RestService to auto-trust SSL connections during rest API calls instead of having to load a certificate
  * Added an option to override and set a default connection timeout for REST HTTP connections 
  * Enhancements to CreditCard util and letting a Person start with a default Card
* **New Utilities**
  * CustomizedEmailableReport 
    * A listener for test suites that will create a cleaner HTML than TestNG. This is intended for CI/CD tools to pickup and email out
  * DriverManager
    * The driver instantiation has been removed from WebBaseTest and is intended to be started via DriverManager. This removes the requirement OrasiDriver must be used by going through WebBaseTest when in some cases, WebBaseTest was not applicable. 
    * It is still intended when using WebBaseTest, that the test is still started via testStart

## Version 1.1.0 - 03/07/2017
**Enhancements**
* [**com.orasi.core.interfaces**](https://github.com/Orasi/Chameleon/tree/master/src/main/java/com/orasi/core/interfaces)
  * Element interfaces has seen performance increases due to an update on when the element is searched for. On creation, the Element will attempt a findElement, but will only search with 1 ms timeout. If found, it is cached. Upon usage of the Element, if the cached Element has because stale or if it was not found to begin with, then it will reload/research itself again. 
  * Many methods with throw dedicated exceptions to allow better handling of test flows. Fox example, if a option was not present in a Listbox, an **OptionNotInListboxException** will be thrown instead of **RuntimeException**. If a syncVisible fails, it will throw a **ElementNotVisibleException**. Additionally, a general **AutomationException** was created that can be fed other custom exception classes. It also will output system info to stacktrace for easier debugging.
* [**com.orasi.utils.TestReporter**](https://github.com/Orasi/Chameleon/tree/master/src/main/java/com/orasi/utils)
   New logging methods have been added and TRACE logs have been added to various low-level areas of the toolkit. Usability is as follows
 * TestReporter.NONE (Default):  No additional info printed to console
 * TestReporter.INFO: Will print useful information to console such as URL's, parameters, and RQ/RS
 * TestReporter.DEBUG: Will print debugging information for test developer to console 
 * TestReporter.TRACE: Will print low level information to console from the framework 
   * New Methods
      * setDebugLevel(TestReporter.___) - Using on the the options above (NONE, INFO, DEBUG, or TRACE) will display logs in the console and TestNG report up to that level
      * logInfo(String log) - The first level of logs. This are intended to write useful info to the console to display what the script is doing, but isn't always needed. 
      * logDebug(String log) - The second level of logs intended for developers where they may leave debug messages to display to step through more complex automation code
      * logTrace(String log) - This level of log is intended for the Toolkit itself, where almost every miniscule action in the low levels of the code is displayed and recorded. This is intended to be used for when there are issues in the toolkit, and assistance from other developers is required.
    * In addition, new Soft Assertions have been added. This allows a test to report out multiple failures until explictly called to fail
      * softAssertTrue(boolean condition, String description) - If condition is not met, report to TestNG log of failure. If assertAll() is called, test will fail.
      *  softAssertFalse(boolean condition, String description) - If condition is not met, report to TestNG log of failure. If assertAll() is called, test will fail.
      *  softAssertEquals(Object value1, Object value2, String description) - If both objects are not equal, report to TestNG log of failure. If assertAll() is called, test will fail.
      * softAssertNull(Object condition, String description) - If object condition is not null, report to TestNG log of failure. If assertAll() is called, test will fail.
      * softAssertNotNull(Object condition, String description) - If object condition is null, report to TestNG log of failure. If assertAll() is called, test will fail.   
      * assertAll() - If any soft assert have failed, fail test 
* [**com.orasi.utils.TestEnvironment**](https://github.com/Orasi/Chameleon/tree/master/src/main/java/com/orasi/utils)
   * Removed a lot of code that was made redundant when OrasiDriver was created.
   * Removed location type of "Remote" in favor of dedicated "Sauce" and "Grid".
   * Added location type of "Mobile".  
    
**New Classes**

   * [Party](https://github.com/Orasi/Chameleon/wiki/Party.java) Collection of multiple Person objects with additional helper methods
   * [DataWarehouse](https://github.com/Orasi/Chameleon/wiki/DataWarehouse.java) Simplified Hashmap built to quickly add, remove and update data. Intended to be used within the OrasiDriver.

  * Enhancements
   * Updated internal core code to associate driver to elements when the OrasiDriver.find methods or @FindBy annotations are used.
